	<h1>Users and their types</h1><br/>
		 <img src="img/usuarios.jpg"/><br/>
	<p>Users log into the application after being registered in it. The only users that can sign up
	new users are those of the Administrator type.<br/><br/>
	The user types are:<br/>
	Administrators: They have access to all the system's features.<br/>
	Advanced Users: They can execute both basic and configured CBR cycles, check their stats and insert
	cases of the types the Administrators have assigned to them.<br/>
	Basic Users: They can perform the same actions of an advanced user, except for executing configured CBR cycles.<br/><br/>
	</p>
	<h1>Actions over the users</h1>
	<p> The buttons at the lower area of the window allow to perform many operations over the users.<br/>
	 <b>Visualize</b>: It allows to see the selected user's data and modify them. This includes assigning/unassigning case types to an user.<br/>
	 <b>Create</b>: Allow to create a new user of any type, including administrators.<br/>
	 <b>Delete</b>: Deletes the selected user. <br/>
	 For security reasons, there always exists an administrator named 'root', unerasable.</p>
