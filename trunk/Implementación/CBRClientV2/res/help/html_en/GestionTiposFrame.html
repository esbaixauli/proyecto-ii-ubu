	<h1>Case types</h1>
	<p>Case types represent the many kinds of problems the application can solve.
	 Each type is composed of a set of problem attributes, a set of solution attributes and a measurement of the solution's
	 quality, from 0 to 100.</p>
	 <h2>Case types vs. cases</h2>
	 <p>A case type represents a kind of problem and its corresponding solution type,
	 while a case is a concrete occurrence of a case type.<br/>
	 For example, a case type "Car malfunction" may comprise the problem attributes: <br/>
	 "Malfunction Description"<br/>
	 "Engine temperature"<br/>
	 "Tyres pressure"<br/>
	 and its solution may comprise the attributes:<br/>
	 "Diagnose"<br/>
	 Meanwhile, a concrete case for this type could be:<br/>
	 "Smoke coming out of the hood","248ºF","33PSI"/"Engine overheating","3.5"</p>
	 <h2>Actions over the case types</h2>
