	<h1>K-NN Retrieval</h1>
	<p>In this kind of retrieval, the N Nearest Neighbours to the user query are chosen. That is, for each case stored in the program the partial distance
	of each attribute (Da) to its equivalent in the query (calculated by the attribute metric) is measured.
	Then, in each case those results are added, obtaining a case score (Cs) of that case relative to the query.
	Finally, the K (A value specified in the method configuration ) cases that have scored a <b>better</b> Cs are chosen.</p>
	 <h1>K-NN retrieval example</h1>
	 <p> We have defined in our program a case type whose problema attributes are A(number),B(number), C(text) and whose solution is D(text).
	 Numeric attributes have its metric defined <A HREF="ConceptosBasicos.html">(See basic concepts, Metrics section)</A></p>
	  as 'Equality', and the attribute C has its metric defined as 'longest substring'.
	  For it, there are 2 stored cases:<br/>

	 <b>Case x:</b>Problem:[2,2,'test'] Solution:['solution X'] <br/>
	 <b>Case y:</b>Problem:[3,5,'testing'] Solution:['solution Y']<br/>
	 Then, for the user query: [3,2,'testing'], if we request a K-NN retrieval<b>with a parameter of 1</b>:<br/>
	 Case x score: 0+1+(4/7) = 11/7<br/>
	 Case y score: 1+0+(7/7) = 14/7<br/>
	 As such, the case selected will be y, since it has a better score, and the solution displayed will be 'Solution Y'.
