	<h1>Retrieval:Diverse By Median</h1>
	<p>In Diverse by Median retrieval the median for each attribute of the case type, between all the cases stored, is calculated.  
	 After that, each case is evaluated in the following fashion:<br/>
	 Each attribute in the case is compared to its median. If its difference relative to the median exceeds a threshold (In excess or defect),
	 defined for each attribute, the case 'score' is added 1.
	 Finally, the case with a lesser score is retrieved (The first found in case of a tie).<br/>
	<b>Note</b>: This version of diverse by median only returns the most similar case (It's not configurable).
	</p>
	<h2> Example:</h2>
	<p>Assume a case base whose case type has the attributes A,B,C and SOLUTION. The attribute's medians for this case type are 0,1,2,3 (Calculated as
	the median of each attribute for each case stored in the program).
	 Suppose that the threshold for all the attributes is 0.5. Then, a case 'x' stored in the program with values 1,0,2.2,3
	 would obtain a score of 2 (Because its attributes A and B are separated to their medians by more than 0.5), while a case 'y' of values 0,1,1.5,3.1
	 would receive a score of 1 (Because of its attribute 2). Then, the case y would be returned as the retrieval result.</p>
