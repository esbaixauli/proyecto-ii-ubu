	<h1>Numeric Proportion</h1>

	 <p>The Numeric proportion method performs a proportion between a pair of problem and solution attributes (Only for numeric attributes).
	 It calculates the difference between the query attribute and the attribute found in a retrieved case and alters the original query in that
	 proportion. For example, suppose there is a query of a case type which has number attributes A,B,C and SOLUTION. Suppose as well that a retrieved
	 case (from the retrieval step) is {{2,2,3},SOLUTION = 8} and the method is numeric proportion between A and SOLUTION.
	 The user query is {1,2,3}. Then, since in the user query A had a value of 1 and the retrieved case shows a value of 2, we calculate
	 (Query A/Retrieved case A) = 1/2. SOLUTION will, then, multiplied by 1/2, and the retrieved adapted case will be {{2,2,3},SOLUTION = 4}
	 </p>
	<h1>Direct Copy</h1>
	 <p>Direct Copy method simply copies an attribute from a query performed by the user in the case returned by the retrieval.
	 For example, suppose a query of a case type which has number attributes A,B,C and SOLUTION.
	 The user query is {1,2,3}.  Suppose as well that a retrieved case (from the retrieval step) is {{2,2,3},SOLUTION = 8} and
	 the adaptation method is Direct Copy for the A attribute. Then, the attribute A from the query (1) is copied into the retrieved case's attribute A,
	 and the adapted case will be {{1,2,3},SOLUTION = 8}.</p>
	 <h1>Combine Query and Cases </h1>
	 <p>This method does not require configuration. It simply copies the attributes from a user query over its equivalents in the retrieved case.<br/>
	 For example, suppose a query of a case type which has number attributes A,B,C and SOLUTION.
	 The user query is {1,7,7}.<br/>
	 Suppose as well that a retrieved case (from the retrieval step) is {{2,2,3},SOLUTION = 8} and the selected method is Combine Query and Cases.
	 Then, the adapted case will be {{1,7,7},SOLUTION=8}.
