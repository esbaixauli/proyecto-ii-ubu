	<h1>Retrieval: Filter-Based</h1>
	<p>In filter-Based retrieval, a logical condition that must be satisfied when compared to the user query is established for each problem attribute.
	 Then, all the cases that coincide with the filters are selected, if some exist.</p>
	 <h1>Example: Filter-Based retrieval</h1>
	 <p>
	 We have defined in the program a case type whose problem attributes are A(number),B(number),C(text) and whose solution is D(text).
	 For it, 3 stored cases exist:<br/>
	 <b>Case x:</b>Problem:[2,2,'test'] Solution:['solution X'] <br/>
	 <b>Case y:</b>Problem:[3,5,'testing'] Solution:['solution Y']<br/>
	 <b>Case z:</b>Problem:[3,7,'test'] Solution:['solution Z']<br/>
	 Then, for the user query:[3,2,'testing'], we use a filter based retrieval using the following filters:
	 For attribute A, equality with the corresponding attribute in the user query (3)<br/>
	 For attribute B, superiority to the corresponding attribute in the user query (5)<br/>
	 For attribute A, inequality with the corresponding attribute in the user query ('testing')<br/>
	 Then, the case x is discarded for not fulfilling the equality condition in attribute A (2!=3). The case y is discarded because it
	 doesn't follow the inequality condition in attribute C ('testing'='testing'). The only case that fulfills all of the predicates is case z, which
	 will be, along with its solution ('solution Z') the search result.
