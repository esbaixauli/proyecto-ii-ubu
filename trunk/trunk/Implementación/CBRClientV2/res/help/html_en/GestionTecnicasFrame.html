	<h1>Methods of a case type</h1>
	<p>Methods represent the various methods that the CBR can use in each CBR cycle step when a user performs a query.
	 At the very least there must always be a method for each step (Which will become the Default Method), but the
	 administrator can check which ones can be utilized by the users in a configured CBR cycle. There exists a technique
	 type for each CBR step;
	<br/>Retrieval methods establish the way in which the most similar cases to the queried problem are obtained.
	<br/>Adaptation (Reuse) methods establish how the cases selected in the retrieval are recombined in a solution
	 to the user's problem.
	<br/>Revision methods establish how the user is allowed to indicate the proposed solution's degree of correctness and alter
	 said solution if needed.</p>
	<br/>Retain methods define the way in which the solution revised by the user is integrated into the system.<br/>
	 For each method type a panel similar to this appears:<br/>

	 The checkboxes to the left of each method allow to enable or disable that method, to allow or impede an user from
	 utilize it. Additionally, some methods allow for certain parameters needed for the methods' use to be configured. 
	 Finally, a dropdown list allows the administrator to select which method will be used as default in each step.
