	<h1>CBR basics</h1>
	<h2>What is CBR?</h2>
	<p> In the field of Artificial Intelligence, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a problem resolution paradigm based on the reutilization 
	 and adaptation of solutions given to similar previous problems, being a field that has experienced a great growth since the 90s decade in the
	 academic field as well as in commertial applications.
	 This paradigm represents in many aspects a fundamentally different vision to other AI approximations relative to problem resolution.
	 Instead of being based exclusively in general knowledge of the problem's domain, or making associations through existing relationships between problems
	 and conclusions, CBR is able to use the specific knowledge of concrete situations previously experienced (solved cases) to solve a problem (case). A new
	 case is solved searching for a similar solved case and reusing it in the new problem's situation.
	</p>
	 <h2>What does this application allow you to do?</h2>
	 <p>This application allows you to connect to a cloud-computing CBR service. It puts to use the power of many remote computers to give solutions
	 to problems. Its users define the problem and solution's characteristics and initially introduce situations in which the problem has appeared and which
	 solution was given. Later on the CBR will generate solutions to problems similar to those introduced by its users and store how good they've been.
	 The more situations introduced and the bigger the amount of application executions, the more effective the system will be.
	 </p>
	 <h2>Steps in a CBR cycle</h2>
	 <p>In a CBR cycle, the user inputs a problem and is shown similar problems stored in the application and its solutions.
	  As a general rule, the four steps are:<br/>
	 <b>Retrieve</b>: Obtain from the case base the most similar ones<br/>
	 <b>Reuse</b>: Use the information of the most similar case/s to create a new solution<br/>
	 <b>Revise</b>: Check that the solution given is appropiate and modify its data if the user deems so.<br/>
	 <b>Retain</b>: Introduce the new solved case (Failed solutins may be included) to the case base.
	 </p>
	 <h2>Common terms</h2>
	 <p><b>Case type</b> -A problem-solution set. It has many attributes, which define the structure of said problem and its solution.
	 For example:<br/>
	 Case type:Car malfunction<br/>
 	 Problem attributes:Engine temperature, noise level, oil levels<br/>
	 Solution attributes:Type of malfunction, repair cost, estimated hours<br/>
	 </p>
	 <p><b>Case</b> -A concrete instance of a case type. For example, for the previous case type, a case would be:<br/>
	 Problem: 80º,120 dBA, 'low' ---> Solution:Engine failure,450€,4 hours.
	 </p>
	 <p><b>Metric</b> -Mean to compare whether an attribute for a given case is similar to its equivalent in another case. For example, consider the
	 following cases, of the Car malfunction case type:<br/>
		 80º,120 dBA,'low' -> Engine failure, 450€,4 hours.<br/>
		 132º,90 dBA,'very low' ->Overheating,100€,2 hours.<br/>
	 For the Oil levels attribute, whose values are 'low' and 'very low' if we use an Exact Equality metric, 'low' will not be considered to be similar	 
	 to 'very low' at all (0% similarity). Searches that require a 'low' oil level will undervalue or outright ignore the previous cases in which 
	 the level is 'very low'. In contrast, with the Metric 'longest substring' (Higher text match), 'low' does have some similarity, and will be considered
	 in problems with 'low' oil level.<br/><br/>
	 The metrics available in this version of the application are:<br/>
	 Equality: Exact equality between 2 elements. Will be considered maximum (100%) if the 2 attributes are exactly the same and minimal (0%) if they aren't.<br/>
	 Ex:Exact equality between 'low' and 'very low' = 0%, Exact equality between 'low' and 'Low'=0%, Exact equality between 80 and 80 = 100%<br/><br/>
	 Equality Ignoring upper/lower case (Only for text strings): It behaves like Equality for text strings, but ignoring upper/lower case.<br/>
	 Ex: Equality ignoring case between 'low' and 'LoW' = 100%.<br/><br/>
	 Longest substring (Only for text strings):Compares the amount of letters in the text string that are identical.<br/>
	 Ex:Longest substring between 'low' and 'very low' = 3/8 = 37.5%
	 Interval (Only for numerics): Requires an 'interval' parameter  determined by the user. It uses the following formulae:
	 1-(|attribute1 - attribute2|/interval).<br/>
	 Ex:Interval [ 80 ] between 35 and 75 = 1 - (40/80) = 1/2 = 50 % <br/><br/>
	 Threshold (Only for numerics): Requires a 'threshold' parameter determined by the user. Returns 100% similarity if the difference (ignoring sign) between
	 the 2 attributes is less than said threshold, and 0% if it isn't.
	 Ex:Threshold[ 0.25 ] between 40 and 39.8 = 100%. Threshold [ 0.25 ] between 40 and 39.7 = 0%. Threshold [ 0.25 ] between 40 and 40.2 = 100%<br/>
	 </p>
	 <p><b>Method</b> -The way in which each step in the CBR cycle is performed. For example, a retrieval method can be based on retrieving
	 the cases whose attributes are more similar to the given problem(according to each attribute's metric), or could decide which cases are
	 retrieved by ignoring or including those who satisfy a specific condition.
	 (For example, in a Car malfunction case, it could search those cases that show higher engine temperatures than those in the given query).
