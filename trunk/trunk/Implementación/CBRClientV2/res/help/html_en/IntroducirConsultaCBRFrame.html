	<h2>Basic and configurated queries</h2>
	<p><b>Basic users</b> can only perform basic queries. This kind of queries allow only to insert the problem data to obtain a solution. 
	<b>advanced users</b> can perform configured queries. In them you can introduce, besides the problem data, the way (metric) and weight
	(degree of relevance) each attribute will be configured, as well as the technique that will be used in each step of the CBR cycle.</p>
