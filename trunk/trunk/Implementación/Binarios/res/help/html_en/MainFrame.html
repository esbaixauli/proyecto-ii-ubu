	<h3>Manage case types</h3>
	 <p>A case type is a Problem-solution pair in which concrete cases will be stored. The option
	 Manage Case Types allows you to define, modify and delete case types, determining its attribute composition,
	 the manner in which they're evaluated and how a query on that type is performed in each CBR step.</p>
	 <h3>Manage users</h3>
	 <p>This window allows you to create, modify and delete the different users of the application.<p/>
	<h2>User actions</h2>
	<h3>Execute CBR cycle</h3>
	<p>Executing a CBR (Case Based Reasoning) cycle consists of performing a query for a concrete case type.
	The user will be asked for the query data and a solution will be offered, which can then be evaluated from 0 to 100
	for future queries.
	<br/>The configured CBR query option is restricted to advanced users and allows to establish the metric (Evaluation method)
	for each attribute, its weight when searching for a solution and the methods to use in each CBR cycle step.</p>
	 <h3>Import cases</h3>
	 <p>The import cases option allows you to introduce cases for a concrete case type manually or from a WEKA file,
	 so the case base of that type is more complete.</p>
	 <h3>Statistics</h3>
	 <p>Full stats of the application usage by its users. Regular users can only see their own stats, while
	 administrators can see global stats or filter by user and case type</p>
