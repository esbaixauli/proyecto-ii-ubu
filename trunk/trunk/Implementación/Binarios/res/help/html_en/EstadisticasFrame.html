	<h1>Statistics</h1>
	<h2>See your own statistics</h2>
 Administrators can see statistics for each user and each case, as well as see global statistics for each case or user and delete sets of statistics.
 The rest of the users are restricted to see their own statistics, in a global manner for each case type.
 In this panel you are shown a case type list, in which the -Global-- option is also included. Pick a case from the list and you'll be shown a stats report to your
 right, with visual graphs of the data. You can alternate between graphics choosing their corresponding tab, generate a report in .pdf format with the 
 'Generate Report' or export the graph (By clicking on it and selecting Export or in the bottom menu).<br/><br/>
The following are the generated stats:<br/>
Total CBR executions: Times the cycle has been executed for that case type. (Sum of executed queries amount if the Global option has been picked)<br/>
Average quality of solution:Average quality for that case type. (Average of all cases if the Global option has been picked)<br/>
Latest execution date: Latest execution of this case. (Latest execution of any type if the Global option has been picked)<br/>
Latest execution quality: Quality of the lates execution of this case. (Quality of the latest of any type if the Global option has been picked)<br/>
Successful solutions: Solutions to user executions for that case type whose success rate given by the user surpasses 50%. (Successful solutions for any case type if the Global option has been picked)<br/>
Percentage of successful: Percentage of successful solutions relative to the totals for that case type. (For any case type if the Global option has been picked)<br/>
Useless solutions: Solutions to user executions for that case type whose success rate is 0%. (Unusable solutions for any case type if the Global option has been picked)<br/>
Useless percentage: Percentage of unusable solutions relative to the totals for that case type. (For any case type if the Global option has been picked)<br/>

 <h2>Statistics by user and case</h2>
 To see the statistics by user and case:<br/>
 If you are an administrator below the 'own stats' option, the tab to see stats by user and case will appear. Pick this tab.
 You will be shown the same stats a user is shown when he sees his own statistics, with the difference that you can see them for any user in any case type, 
 the globals for a case type or the user globals.
 In addition, you can delete all the stats of a user, a case or those of a specific user and case.
 To choose the stats for a user and case, pick from the user list the one you want (or -Global-- if you wish to see all the users'). In the same fashion,
 pick from the list of cases the one you want, or the -Global option for all cases. You will automatically be shown the requested stats.
 You can delete the selected set of statistics by picking the 'Trashcan' option in the button panel below.
