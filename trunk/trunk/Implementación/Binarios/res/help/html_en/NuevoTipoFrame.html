	<h1>Create a new case type</h1>
	<h2>Case type components</h2>
	<p>A case type is composed of the following:<br/>
	-A set of <b>problem attributes</b>. Each attribute has a <b>weight</b> and a default evaluation <b>metric</b>.
	which will be used in a query if the user doesn't/can't specify a value for those fields.<br/>
	-A set of<b>solution attributes</b>.<br/>
	-A list of <b>method</b> allowed in each cycle step. Out of those there will be one which will be used as the default in a basic cycle or if the user doesn't
	 pick one while performing a query.<A HREF="IntroducirConsultaCBRFrame.html">(See help section about queries).</A><br/>
	-The configuration of each allowed method.
	</p>
	<h2>Add/delete attributes</h2><br/>

	<p>To add an attribute to the problem or solution, click the '+' button:<img src="img/mas.png"/>.
		To delete it, click the button: <img src="img/borrar.png"/>. Please note there must be an attribute for the problem and one for the solution.
	</p>
	<h2>Fill out attributes</h2>
	<p>Its mandatory to fill out every field from each attribute. To do that, fill the name of each attribute (It must be unique).
	 After that, you must pick the attribute type. The allowed types are:<br/>
	 -Character string For example:"Test"<br/>
	 -Integer number. For example:2<br/>
	 -Decimal number.For example:2.3<br/>
	 Finally, you must pick a default metric. The default metrics depend on the attribute type. For example, the longest substring comparison isn't available
	 for Integer numbers or decimals. Some metrics require a configurating parameter.

	 <h2>Setting methods</h2>
	 <br/>
	<img src="img/tecnicas.jpg"/><br/>
	
	 <p>To set the methods, click the 'Next' (Arrow) button. The program will check the following:<br/>
	 -That each attribute has been filled out and that there are no repeated attribute names.<br/>
	 -That the case type name has not been picked yet and doesn't contain spaces or special characters.<br/>
	 Then the methods panel will be shown,
	 including a subpanel for each CBR cycle step. To the left of each method is a checkbox which indicates if that method will be available for the users 
	 (At least one will always be picked). The dropdown list of each panel allows you to pick which method will be used if the user can't/won't pick one when performing
	 a query.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Some techniques can be configured. To do that, click the "Configure" button to the side of each method. If you choose not to configure it, it will take
	 default values.
	 </p>
	 <h2>Last steps</h2>
	 <p>To finish, click the Save button to save the case type, which from now on can be viewed and modified. Now you will also be able to perform all the
	 other actions related to case types with the new case.
