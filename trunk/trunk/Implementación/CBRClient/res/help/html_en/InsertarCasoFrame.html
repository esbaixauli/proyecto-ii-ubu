	<h1>Importing cases</h1>
	<p>The application allows to import cases of a defined type, filling the application's case base with them.
	 This ensures that there exists enough data for the users to perform CBR queries, so the case base will get feedback
	 with the information they provide.
	</p>
	<h2>File importing</h2>
	<p>You can import WEKA files in *.arff format (Check <A HREF="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/arff.html"> this link </A>
	to see those files' format).
	 The file should contain a column for each field of the case type that is being imported, whose name and data type match the Case Type
	 specification. There must also exist an attribute named META_QUALITY of NUMERIC type, which indicates the quality level of the
	 case from 0 to 100. To sum up, a valid *.arff file should have the following appearance:<br/><br/>
	<img src="img/arff.png"/><br/><br/>
	 To load the file, from the import from file panel, click on the "Open" button and once a file has been selected (Its path will appear
	 on the text area to the left), click "Load from file".<br/><br/>
	 <img src="img/cargarfichero.png"/><br/>
	 You'll see how the cases appear in the table below. The problem attributes appear in red, the solution attributes in blue and the quality in green.<br/>
	 Now you can modify, order (clicking on each column's header) or search in the table (with the filter shown below). Once you're done, you can
	 click on the "Insert cases" button to complete the operation.<br/><br/>
	  <img src="img/filtrar.png"/><br/>
	  Remember the filter accepts basic regular expressions, following the common convention.
	</p>

	<h2>Manual import</h2>
	</p>You can also introduce a new case from the manual import panel located at the lowermost of the window.
	 Simply fill up the form and push the "Manual Insert" button. Remember that the quality is an attribute from 0 to 100.<p>
